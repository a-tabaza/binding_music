You know?\nI can't teach no one how to hustle, some man just got it\nBack then I got chased by feds, I ran out of breath and I wanted to vomit\nI hit that freak, she put me in cuffs, it triggered my trauma, I tell her to stop it\nShe wanna know if I'm really ballin', that girl there wanna weigh my wallet\n\n[Verse 2: Central Cee]\nWe ain't doin' irrational get backs, creep up clean when they least expect it\nHygiene's poor, look at the floor, there's insects crawlin', I could've got sepsis\nNasty, still try fuck on my step-sis (Huh)\nRan through 'nough of these famous girls,but I still got some on my checklist\nBare gunman on my guestlist\nI took bro-bro out of the trenches\nJump out the Volvo, jump out the Lexus, active\nHe ain't got no preference, slapped it\nBut, when I retrospected, I could've been calm and collected\nAvoided a problem and fleed the scene\nToo vocal, don't need no beat\nI go old-school like Evisu Jeans\nWho's that with the cargos and Corteiz?\nThe back poke out and the waist petite\nGot flown out all the way to Greece\nShe got great physique\n\n[Verse 3: Dave]\n2 A.M., I'm callin' Clint, like, \"Yo, who's that girl in the vest?\"\nI'll send a delivery text, I know that it's wrong, it is what it is\nBroski locked, I'm visitin' him\nBrought eaters to the prison for him\nVision for him, and it's bigger than him\nDisrespect, I'm sizzlin' him\nThat girl look like SZA to me\nHow you upset that I cut you off when you basically handed the scissors to me?\nTwo-man step, diligently (Grrah)\nWatch my back vigilantly\nMy young boy do man differently\nShe wanna show them girl she know me, call my government name\nI never tucked my shirt in school, so why would I grow up and tuck my chain?\nHide my face like, \"Fuck the fame\"\nTrust indifferent, but love's the same\n\n[Verse 4: Central Cee]\nI don't trust anyone lately, this lifestyle sendin' me crazy\nWho's to say that they'll never betray me?

And did you know\nYour stairway lies on the whispering wind? Oh\n\n[Guitar Solo]\n\n[Bridge]\nAnd as we wind on down the road\nOur shadows taller than our soul\nThere walks a lady we all know\nWho shines white light and wants to show\nHow everything still turns to gold\nAnd if you listen very hard\nThe tune will come to you at last\nWhen all are one, and one is all, yeah\nTo be a rock and not to roll\n\n[Outro]\nAnd she's buying a stairway to Heaven",

(Ah)\nBig as the what? (Mm)\nBig as the what? (Ayy)\nBig as the Super Bowl\n\n[Verse 1: Drake]\nBut the difference is it's just two guys playin' shit that they did in the studio\nNiggas usually send they verses back to me and they be terrible, just like a two-year-old\nI love a dinner with some fine women when they start debatin' about who the G.O.A.T.\nI'm like go on 'head, say it then, who the G.O.A.T.?\nWho the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.? Who the G.O.A.T.?\nWho you bitches really rootin' for?\nLike a kid that act bad from January to November, nigga, it's just you and Cole\n\n[Chorus: Drake]\nBig as the what? (Ah)\nBig as the what? (Mm)\nBig as the what? (Ayy)\nBig as the Super Bowl\n\n[Verse 2: J. Cole]\nNiggas so thirsty to put me in beef\nDissectin' my words and start lookin' too deep\nI look at the tweets and start suckin' my teeth\nI'm lettin' it rock 'cause I love the mystique\nI still wanna get me a song with YB\nCan't trust everything that you saw on IG\nJust know if I diss you, I'd make sure you know that I hit you like I'm on your caller ID\nI'm namin' the album The Fall Off, it's pretty ironic 'cause it ain't no fall off for me\nStill in this bitch gettin' bigger, they waitin' on the kid to come drop like a father to be\nLove when they argue the hardest MC\nIs it K-Dot? Is it Aubrey? Or me?\nWe the big three like we started a league, but right now, I feel like Muhammad Ali\nHuh, yeah, yeah, huh-huh, yeah, Muhammad Ali\nThe one that they call when they shit ain't connectin' no more, feel like I got a job in IT\nRhymin' with me is the biggest mistake\nThe Spider-Man meme is me lookin' at Drake\nIt's like we recruited your homies to be demon deacons, we got 'em attending your wake\nHate how the game got away from the bars, man, this shit like a prison escape\nEverybody steppers, well, fuck it, then everybody breakfast and I'm 'bout to clear up my plate (Huh, huh, huh)\nWhen I show up, it's motion picture blockbuster\nThe G.O.A.T. with the golden pen, the top toucher\nThe spot rusher, sprayed his whole shit up, the crop duster\nNot Russia, but apply pressure\nTo your cranium, Cole's automatic when aimin' 'em\nWith The Boy in the status, a stadium\nNigga\n\n[Part II]\n\n[Intro: Drake]\nAyy, I'm 'bout to, I'm bout to\nI'm 'bout to, yeah\nYeah\n\n[Verse: Drake]\nI'm 'bout to click out on this shit\nI'm 'bout to click, woah\nI'm 'bout to click out on this shit\nI'm 'bout to click, woah\nI'm down to click out you hoes and make a crime scene\nI click the trigger on the stick like a high beam\nMan, I was Bentley wheel whippin' when I was nineteen\nShe call my number, leave her hangin', she got dry-cleaned\nShe got a Android, her messages is lime green\nI search one name, and end up seein' twenty tings\nNadine, Christine, Justine, Kathleen, Charlene, Pauline, Claudine\nMan, I pack 'em in this phone like some sardines\nAnd they send me naked pictures, it's the small things\nYou niggas still takin' pictures on a Gulfstream\nMy youngins richer than you rappers and they all stream\nI really hate that you been sellin' them some false dreams\nMan, if your pub was up for sale, I buy the whole thing\nWill they ever give me flowers? Well, of course not\nThey don't wanna have that talk, 'cause it's a sore spot\nThey know The Boy, the one they gotta boycott\nI told Jimmy Jam I use a GRAMMY as a door stop\nGirl gave me some head because I need it\nAnd if I fuck with you, then after I might eat it, what?\nNiggas talkin' 'bout when this gon' be repeated\nWhat the fuck, bro? I'm one away from Michael\nNigga, beat it, nigga, beat it, what?\n\n[Outro: Drake]\nBeat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?\nBeat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, what?\nBeat it, what? Beat it, what? Beat it, ayy, beat it, what?\nDon't even pay me back on none them favors, I don't need it",

Merely a memory\nI intervene 'cause I tend to be a lil' more optimistic than the wildest child or the most imaginative\nI sip the tea after my opinion\nThey Pistol Pete, dishin' out assistance, government aid\nWhat does it take to break the mold, ayy, I hate the po' like the base is low\nBut I'm out the park like the acre gone\nSaba with the sabre sword\nFocusin' on what we can't afford, in the scheme of things, guess it just ain't important\nWho wasn't broke for a moment or three\nStart stainin' like, \"Oh, it was free,\" then stop for a moment of peace\nAnd plus they would call the police if you kept showin' ya face\nI said I stopped dreamin', instead I decided to chase\nAnd I ain't look back, that's how you turn to stone\nMy first friend up in high school was a Stone\nHe said come and join, I ain't come along\nNot cause I'm high and mighty, just I knew right from wrong\nSomewhere I belong, looked, but I didn't find\nBut instead of getting discouraged, I got my city behind\nNow I'm feelin' worldwide, next stop NY\nNext month L.A., then back West Side\nYou change when a friend dies, new man since I lost Kobe\nHe got out of prison then called my phone like, \"Where COMFORTZone?\"\nAnd since then I lost touch, but this year I'm gettin' it back\nI finally feel like myself, what I've been on, don't even ask\nThey ask me, \"Why the Bucket List?\"\nYou know the bucket list, I finally climbed the rock\nMade it to the top of the precipice\nI came from the pessimism of inner city as it is\nAccident prone youth, adult say, \"Don't take a chance\"\nBut we never listen, we went and did it, they vision impaired\nSo what do you fear, and why are you scared?\nWhy are you scared? Why are you scared?\n\n[Chorus: Saba & Ravyn Lenae]\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove\nThe right direction\n'Cause I don't wanna slow\nDown for no gas\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove\nThe right direction\n'Cause I don't wanna slow\nDown for no gas\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\nHmmm-mm-mm, Cali, Cali\nSee the horizon from the road, and hope that we drove (Drove)\nThe right direction\n'Cause I don't wanna slow (Slow)\nDown for no gas\nAnd plus I'm runnin' low on cash (Cash)\nBut I know that my bucket gon' make it to California, California\n\n[Interlude: Lupe Fiasco]\nYo yo yo what up?

Then say, \"Fuck your haters\"\nI can see the baller in you, I can see the dollar in you\nLittle white lies, but it's no white-collar in you\nBut it's whatever though because I'm still followin' you\nBecause you make me live forever, baby\nCount it all together, baby\nThen hit the register and make me feel better, baby\nYour horoscope is a Gemini, two sides\nSo you better cop everything two times\nTwo coupes, two chains, two C-notes\nToo much ain't enough, both we know\nChristmas, tell 'em what's on your wish list\nGet it all, you deserve it, Kendrick\nAnd when you hit the White House, do you\nBut remember, you ain't pass economics in school\nAnd everything you buy, taxes will deny\nI'll Wesley Snipe your ass before thirty-five\n\n[Bridge: George Clinton & Kendrick Lamar]\nYeah, lookin' down, it's quite a drop (It's quite a drop, drop, drop)\nLookin' good when you're on top (We\u2019re on top together)\nYou got a medal for us\nLeavin' metaphors metaphysically in a state of euphoria\nLook both ways before you cross my mind\n\n[Refrain: Thundercat & George Clinton]\nWe should never gave\nWe should never gave niggas money\nGo back home, money, go back home\nWe should never gave\nWe should never gave niggas money\nGo back home, money, go back home\n\n[Outro: Anna Wise & Whitney Alford]\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'\nTax man comin', tax man comin'",

Why do I deserve this?\nSo we're different, why do I deserve to die now?\nGive me a reason why?\n\n[Pre-Chorus 1]\nThen it all goes a blur\nLet instinct take flight\nFind my hands on his throat\nYet hear myself say\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTell me now, who taught you how to hate?\n'cause it isn't in your blood\nNot a part of what you're made\nSo let this be understood\nSomebody taught you how to hate\nWhen you live this way, you become\nDead to everyone\n\n[Verse 2]\nA father's pride, my son walking beside me\nI look around and marvel how the children play\nIn perfect disarray (So innocent)\nNo judgement, pure exhilaration\nBlack to white, the colors aren't on their minds\nNothing predefined (All different)\nThere's always one who plants an evil seed and\nPreaches fear to pull you to the other side\nInto a world of lies\n\n[Pre-Chorus 2]\nEverything is unsure\nWhen you've lost your sight (lost your sight)\nCan there still be a cure?\nWhat made you this way?\n\n[Chorus 1]\nTell me now, who taught you how to hate?\n'cause it isn't in your blood\nNot a part of what you're made\nSo let this be understood\nSomebody taught you how to hate\nWhen you live this way, you become\nDead to everyone\n(You're not anyone)\n\n[Bridge]\nOh!\nLost all innocence\nInfected and arrogant\nYou burn all your life (There's no telling you)\nNo deliverance\nConsumed by the pestilence of hate, you're denied\nDeep in your heart does it still remain?\nDo you think you can bring it\nBack to life again?\nIs it still in your soul? (No saving you)\nWhere's the deviant\nThe unholy revenant\nThat has made you this way?\nMade you fall for this hate\n\n[Chorus 2]\nTell me now, who taught you how to hate?\nBecause it isn't in your blood\nNot a part of what you're made\nSo let this be understood\nSomebody taught you how to hate\nWhen you live this way, you become\n(You become)\n\n[Outro/Chorus]\nTell me now, who taught you how to hate?\nBecause it isn't in your blood\nNot a part of what you're made\nSo let this be understood\nSomebody taught you how to hate\nWhen you live this way, you become (You become)\nYou Become dead to everyone\n(You're not anyone)",

eliminate 'em\nOther words, I Minute Maid 'em\nI don't wanna hurt 'em, but I did, I'm in a fit of rage\nI'm murderin' again, nobody will evade\nI'm finna kill 'em and dump all their fuckin' bodies in the lake\nObliterating everything, incinerate a renegade\nI'm here to make anybody who want it with the pen afraid\nBut don't nobody want it, but they're gonna get it anyway\n'Cause I'm beginnin' to feel like I'm mentally ill\nI'm Attila, kill or be killed, I'm a killer bee, the vanilla gorilla\nYou're bringin' the killer within me outta me\nYou don't wanna be the enemy of the demon who entered me\nAnd be on the receivin' end of me, what stupidity it'd be\nEvery bit of me's the epitome of a spitter\nWhen I'm in the vicinity, motherfucker, you better duck\nOr you finna be dead the minute you run into me\nA hundred percent of you is a fifth of a percent of me\nI'm 'bout to fuckin' finish you, bitch, I'm unfadable\nYou wanna battle, I'm available, I'm blowin' up like an inflatable\nI'm undebatable, I'm unavoidable, I'm unevadable\nI'm on the toilet bowl, I got a trailer full of money and I'm paid in full\nI'm not afraid to pull a\u2014\n\n[Outro: Eminem]\nMan, stop\nLook what I'm plannin', haha",

My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? (Excuse me) My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\n(Can I have the attention of the class for one second?)\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 1: Eminem & Dr. Dre]\nHi, kids, do you like violence? (Yeah, yeah, yeah)\nWanna see me stick nine-inch nails through each one of my eyelids? (Uh-huh)\nWanna copy me and do exactly like I did? (Yeah, yeah)\nTry 'cid and get fucked up worse than my life is? (Huh?)\nMy brain's dead weight, I'm tryna get my head straight\nBut I can't figure out which Spice Girl I want to impregnate (Oh)\nAnd Dr. Dre said, \"Slim Shady, you a basehead\" (Uh-uh)\n\"Then why's your face red? Man, you wasted\"\nWell, since age 12, I felt like I'm someone else\n'Cause I hung my original self from the top bunk with a belt\nGot pissed off and ripped Pamela Lee's tits off\nAnd smacked her so hard I knocked her clothes backwards like Kris Kross\nI smoke a fat pound of grass, and fall on my ass\nFaster than a fat bitch who sat down too fast\nCome here, slut; \"Shady, wait a minute, that's my girl, dawg\"\nI don't give a fuck, God sent me to piss the world off\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 2: Eminem]\nMy English teacher wanted to flunk me in junior high (Shh)\nThanks a lot, next semester I'll be 35\nI smacked him in his face with an eraser, chased him with a stapler\nAnd stapled his nuts to a stack of paper (Ow)\nWalked in the strip club, had my jacket zipped up\nFlashed the bartender, then stuck my dick in the tip cup\nExtraterrestrial, running over pedestrians in a spaceship While they're screaming at me, \"Let's just be friends\"\n99 percent of my life, I was lied to\nI just found out my mom does more dope than I do (Damn)\nI told her I'd grow up to be a famous rapper\nMake a record about doin' drugs and name it after her\n(Oh, thank you)\nYou know you blew up when the women rush your stands\nAnd try to touch your hands like some screamin' Usher fans\n(Ahh, ahh, ahh)\nThis guy at White Castle asked for my autograph (Dude, can I get your autograph?)\nSo I signed it, \"Dear Dave, thanks for the support, asshole\"\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\n\n[Verse 3: Eminem]\nStop the tape, this kid needs to be locked away (Get him)\nDr. Dre, don't just stand there, operate\nI'm not ready to leave, it's too scary to die (Fuck that)\nI'll have to be carried inside the cemetery and buried alive\n(Huh, yup)\nAm I comin' or goin'? I can barely decide\nI just drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive? (Go ahead)\nAll my life I was very deprived\nI ain't had a woman in years and my palms are too hairy to hide (Whoops)\nClothes ripped like the Incredible Hulk\nI spit when I talk, I'll fuck anything that walks (Come here)\nWhen I was little, I used to get so hungry I would throw fits\nHow you gonna breastfeed me, Mom? You ain't got no tits\nI lay awake and strap myself in the bed\nWith a bulletproof vest on and shoot myself in the head (Bang)\n'Cause I'm steamin' mad (Grr)\nAnd by the way, when you see my dad (Yeah?)\nTell him that I slit his throat in this dream I had\n\n[Chorus: Eminem]\nHi, my name is, what? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, what?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, who? My name is, huh?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady\nHi, my name is, huh? My name is, who?\nMy name is, chka-chka, Slim Shady",

Yeah, but he loves you, girl, and you better know it\nWe're all we got in this world when it spins, when it swirls\nWhen it whirls, when it twirls, two little beautiful girls\nLookin' puzzled, in a daze, I know it's confusin' you\nDaddy's always on the move, Mama's always on the news\nI try to keep you sheltered from it, but somehow it seems\nThe harder that I try to do that, the more it backfires on me\nAll the things growin' up as Daddy that he had to see\nDaddy don't want you to see, but you see just as much as he did\nWe did not plan it to be this way, your mother and me\nBut things have got so bad between us, I don't see us ever bein'\nTogether ever again, like we used to be when we was teenagers\nBut then, of course, everything always happens for a reason\nI guess it was never meant to be\nBut it's just somethin' we have no control over, and that's what destiny is\nBut no more worries, rest your head and go to sleep\nMaybe one day we'll wake up and this'll all just be a dream\n\n[Chorus]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\n[Verse 2]\nHeh, it's funny\nI remember back one year when Daddy had no money\nMommy wrapped the Christmas presents up and stuck 'em under the tree\nAnd said some of 'em were from me 'cause Daddy couldn't buy 'em\nI'll never forget that Christmas, I sat up the whole night crying\n'Cause Daddy felt like a bum\u2014see, Daddy had a job\nBut his job was to keep the food on the table for you and Mom\nAnd at the time, every house that we lived in\nEither kept gettin' broken into and robbed or shot up on the block\nAnd your Mom was savin' money for you in a jar\nTryin' to start a piggy bank for you so you could go to college\nAlmost had a thousand dollars 'til someone broke in and stole it\nAnd I know it hurt so bad it broke your Mama's heart\nAnd it seemed like everything was just startin' to fall apart\nMom and Dad was arguin' a lot\nSo Mama moved back on to Chalmers in the flat, one-bedroom apartment\nAnd Dad moved back to the other side of 8 Mile on Novara\nAnd that's when Daddy went to California with his CD\nAnd met Dr. Dre, and flew you and Mama out to see me\nBut Daddy had to work, you and Mama had to leave me\nThen you started seein' Daddy on the TV\nAnd Mama didn't like it\nAnd you and Lainie were too young to understand it\nPapa was a rolling stone, Mama developed a habit\nAnd it all happened too fast for either one of us to grab it\nI'm just sorry you were there and had to witness it firsthand\n'Cause all I ever wanted to do was just make you proud\nNow I'm sittin' in this empty house just reminiscin'\nLookin' at your baby pictures, it just trips me out\nTo see how much you both have grown, it's almost like you're sisters now\nWow, guess you pretty much are, and Daddy's still here\nLainie, I'm talkin' to you too, Daddy's still here\nI like the sound of that, yeah, it's got a ring to it, don't it?\nShh! Mama's only gone for the moment\n\n[Chorus]\nNow hush, little baby, don't you cry\nEverything's gonna be alright\nStiffen that upper lip up, little lady, I told ya\nDaddy's here to hold ya through the night\nI know Mommy's not here right now and we don't know why\nWe feel how we feel inside\nIt may seem a little crazy, pretty baby\nBut I promise Mama's gon' be alright\n\n[Outro]\nAnd if you ask me to, Daddy's gonna buy you a mockingbird\nI'ma give you the world\nI'ma buy a diamond ring for you, I'ma sing for you\nI'll do anything for you to see you smile\nAnd if that mockingbird don't sing and that ring don't shine\nI'ma break that birdie's neck\nI'll go back to the jeweler who sold it to ya\nAnd make him eat every carat, don't fuck with Dad!
